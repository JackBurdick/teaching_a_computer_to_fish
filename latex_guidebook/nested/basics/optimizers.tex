\r{Simply stepping in the direction of the steepest descent for a given location (or batch) is not always the best strategy for convergence. \TD{a figure of this would be nice}}



\subsection{Descent Direction Methods}

\TD{overview of descent direction methods.}

% see C4 of algorithms for optimization


\subsection{First-order}

\r{first-order methods rely on the first derivative (gradient) of the objective function to select the direction to descend.}

\r{The value and gradient for a location can help guide the direction to step, but this first order information does not directly guide the step size.}

\subsubsection{Gradient Descent}
% not sure this belongs right here

\r{Gradient descent refers to descending the gradient of the objective function and is an optimization algorithm that can be used to estimate the local minimum of a function}

\r{Iteratively updates the model parameters by calculating the partial derivatives of the cost function at each step during training}

\r{Gradient descent is only guaranteed to find the local minimum of the cost function.}

\r{simultaneous update.}


\TD{First Order (\ALR), Second Order (\ALR) optimizers. Second-order approximations are based on the Hessian (\ALR) or the objective function and are capable of informing not only the direction to step in, but also the step size.}



\paragraph{Batch Gradient Descent}

\r{batch gradient descent --- taking a step (update the weights) opposite (down) the gradient calculated from the entire training set}

\r{Batch gradient descent is deterministic --- will produce the same paramter values if the same dataset is used multiple times.}

\r{single static error surface}


\paragraph{Stochastic Gradient Descent}

\r{Stochastic Gradient Descent (sometimes called iterative or on-line gradient descent) --- rather than update the weights based on the sum of the accumulated errors, the weights are updated for each training sample}

\r{Stochastic gradient descent is deterministic --- may produce the different parameter values if the same dataset is used multiple times. May not minimize the cost function as well as gradient descent but the approximation is often ``close enough''. One potential downside is that if the approximation of the error surface is not ``good enough'' minimization could take a, relatively speaking, long time.}

\r{rather than the single static error surface, the error surface is now dynamic as it is being estimated during every iteration with respect to only one training example.}


\paragraph{Mini-batch Gradient Descent}

\r{mini-batch gradient descent --- compromise between batch and stochastic gradient descent where the gradient is calculated over a subset of training data (minibatch). The minibatch size then acts as another hyper-parameter.}

\r{Since the gradient is calculated on a single example, the error surface will appear noisier than if it was calculated over a batch or the entire training set.}

\r{When using stochastic gradient descent, it is important to shuffle the data after each epoch.}


% when looking at specific optimizers, http://ruder.io/optimizing-gradient-descent/ was a useful resource

% TODO: these are really subcategories/improvements of gradient descent

\subsubsection{Conjugate Gradient}

% gd can perform poorly in narrow valleys -- orthoganal steps

\TD{include? paragraph?}

\subsubsection{Momentum Descent}

Momentum~\cite{qian1999momentum}

\r{gradient descent can take a long time to traverse flat surfaces}

\r{momentum is intuitively what it sounds like. -- can imagine a ball rolling down a hill where it gains speed as it travels down the slope.}

\TD{figure of momentum}

\TD{figure of gradient descent with and without momentum side by side on the same surfaces.}

\subsubsection{Nesterov Momentum Descent}

% ok. blast probably isn't the best choice here..
\r{Nesterov accelerated gradient (NAG). One issue with momentum can be that the momentum may be ``too strong'' and blast through the bottom and climb the other side}

\r{modifies the momentum values -- \TD{original paper}}

\TD{figure of momentum vs Nesterov}



\subsubsection{Adagrad Descent}
% see p.77 of optimization

\r{Adagrad~\cite{duchi2011adaptive}, \textcolor{red}{will assign frequently occurring features low learning rates}}

\r{\textit{Ada}ptive sub\textit{grad}ient method (\textit{adagrad})}

\r{apdapts a learning rate for each component. Nesterov and Momentum use the same learning rate for each component}

\r{one problem is that the effective learning rate decreases}

\paragraph{Adagrad Extensions: (RMSProp, Adadelta, Adam)}

\TD{extension of adagrad to overcome the decreasing learning rate ...}

\subparagraph{RMSProp}

\r{unpublished -- from Geoff Hinton's lecture for a coursera course}

% ``if small and not v___ let's take bigger jumps'' -took this note

\subparagraph{Adadelta}

\TD{explanation}

\r{Adadelta~\cite{zeiler2012adadelta}, expands on AdaGrad by avoiding reducing the learning rate to zero.}


\subparagraph{Adam}
% not 100% sure this belongs here

\r{Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam)~\cite{kingma2014adam}}

\r{Adaptive moment estimation method (adam)}

\r{similar to both RMSProp and Adadelta in that it stores the exponentially decaying squared gradient}

\r{also uses an exponentially decaying gradient like momentum}

\r{RMSProp plus momentum}

% TODO:
\TD{bias correction step (bias caused by initializing the gradient to zero?)}

\subsubsection{AdaMax}

\TD{TODO:}

\subsubsection{Hypergradient Descent}

% see p.80 of optimizers
\TD{overview}

\r{the derivative of the learning rate may be useful. A hyperparameter gradient, (Hypergradient) is what it sounds like, a derivative taken with respect to a hyperparameter.}

\r{applies gradient descent to the learning rate}
