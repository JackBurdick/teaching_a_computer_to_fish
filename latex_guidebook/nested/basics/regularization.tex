\chapter{Improving Generalizability}

\r{The methods shown in the upcoming sections aim to reduce overfitting. That is, these methods aim to prevent the model from becoming too specialized to the training dataset in hopes that it will generalize to data that it has not specifically seen. It is worth noting that by implementing some of these methods (e.g. reducing the model capacity), the model often has less ability to model the training set as well as it might otherwise be able to. This is ok, but worth remembering such that some of the methods aren't used before they are necessary \TD{section on determining overfitting}.}

% TODO: index overfitting
\r{overfitting: a practical definition may include observing the training loss to improve while the validation loss degrades. \TD{possibly mention \\cite{Nakkiran2020DeepDD}}}

\r{Overfitting --- too complex --- Occam's razor --- hypothesis with the fewest assumptions is best}

\r{A specific instance of improving generalization might be accounting for imblance. Either in the labels or in the features.  Section \ref{app_data_imbalance} discusses this topic and strategies in more detail.}

\section{Data}

\subsection{Data Collection}

\r{Arguably the best way to increase generalizability of a model is to train the model on more data. However, as readers may already be aware, this is not always easy. Collecting more data may not be time/cost effective, or even possible.}

\r{``free'' data in that the ``cost'' is minor computation}

\subsection{Augmentation}

\r{Dataset augmentation is \textcolor{green}{TODO}}

\r{Please note, augmentation must be done responsibly. For example, if performing digit recognition, it would not be wise to perform rotational or flip transformations on the data since, depending on the specific data, a 6, rotated 180 or flipped vertically may now appear as a 9.}


\r{invariances in the data}

\r{For specific techniques, see~\ref{app_aug_techniques}}

\TD{Beyond improving generalization, augmentation may be used in other contexts as well, such as in helping quantify uncertainty -- \TD{see ref ---\TD{Augmenting the test set. A simple augmentation (horizontal filliping) was performed on the test set in \cite{simonyan2014very} -- where the prediction of the original and augmented images are averaged to obtain the final output score.} }}


\subsection{Sampling}

\r{The line between the techniques described here and ``augmentation'' might be a little blurred, in that sampling might technically be considered a augmentation technique (and I'm not even sure ``sampling'' is the appropriate title). But the intended distinction is that in augmentation, we are diliberately altering something (e.g. the input data) and in sampling, we are altering the number of times an architecture sees a particular instance in a training dataset.}

\TD{see appendix section for methods}



\section{Architecture}

\section{Training Pattern}

\subsection{Early Stopping}

\r{see p.243 of DL, papers Bishop 1995 and Sjoberg and Ljung 1995}

% TODO: note about regularization --- the smaller the value, the stronger the regularization.


\subsection{Stochastic Behavior}

\subsubsection{Dropout}

\r{``Dropout'' as a node in a computational graph may be considered an architectural structure change, but the method itself affects the training pattern in possibly not obvious ways. }

% TODO: explain dropout

\r{Dropout -- ref original paper (Hinton? -- intuitive, inspired by bank -- that defrauding the bank would require cooperation between employees to defraud the bank \TD{cite})}.

\r{Dropout (proposed in ``Improving Neural Networks by Preventing Co-Adaption of Feature Dectors''~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1207-0580}, and popularized by Nitish et.al in ``Dropout: a Simple Way to Prevent Nerual Networks from Overfitting''~\cite{JMLR:v15:srivastava14a}}

\r{It is important to note that dropout is only present during training. i.e. dropout does not occur during test/evaluation if using dropout in the ``standard way''. However dropout is occassionally used for evaluation in attempt to quantify model uncertainty \TD{CITATION}}

\r{keeps a neuron active by a hyperparameterized probability.}

\r{used in any/all neurons in the network (other than the output neruons).}

\r{think about where dropout is used. That is when you use dropout at any given nueron the upstream paths transversing that particular neuron are also affected (in this case, ``turned off''), as well downstream connections (but often only modified, not entirely turned off since they often still have other inputs) }

\r{Forces the network to learn mappings even in the absence of all the information, that is the network is forced to consider the values of other values and can't rely on a smaller number of values or groups of values. Said another way, the network is prevented from becoming too dependent on certain inputs or features.}

\r{In this way, dropout can be thought of as sort of an ensembling method. When dropout is in use during training, each loop technically produces a different network that is then trained for the given task. During the next loop, a different network is used. As Aurélien Géron~\cite{geron2019hands} describes, if you train for 10,000 training steps (where dropout is used), you will have likely (almost certainly) trained 10,000 different neural networks. It's true that each network is not indpendant (they share weights), but they are different. More generally, a network with $N$ activations with dropout present, there exist $2^N$ possible networks ($2$ since each activation/neuron/value can have either an `on` or `off` state.) and thus, the use of all of these networks at once can be considered an ensembling of sorts.}

\TD{create figure of this ensemble of many networks.}

	\caption{\TD{Same graph during test --- no dropout applied}}
	\label{fig:regularization_dropout_overview_test}
\end{figure}

\r{It is worth pointing out that since dropout is only applied at training time, comparing the loss curve of training and inference (validation splits) will be a bit misleading since the full ensemble network is used for calculating the validation loss/metrics and only the component \TD{is there a better word than this?} networks are used for the training set.}

\r{Additionally, if you run the training set through multiple times, you may find slightly different results. Again, this is because while dropout is on, you'll find that a slightly different network is used. \TD{This idea can be exploited at inference time to get uncertainty estimates.}}

\r{some important notes about the implementation. The outputs at test time should be equivalent to their expected outputs at training time (which is altered due to the application of dropout).}

\r{Couple solutions}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
	\item scale the outputs during inference
	\item
\end{itemize}

\r{One potential solution to this problem is to scale the outputs during inference in a way that compensates for the dropout probability.  For example, if the dropout rate was set to $0.5$, then it would become necessary to halve the neurons outputs at test time in order to keep the expected output the neurons have learned during training.  However, this may not be ideal in practice since it would require scaling all the neuron outputs at test time (where performance is often critical and more important).}

\r{at test time, multiply the values by the expectation, not the on/off mask}

\r{Another, perhaps more desirable solution, would be to use \IDI{inverted dropout}. The cs231n~\cite{cs231n} course provides a concise explaination and example code on this topic.}

\r{This applies the same principal as outlined above, only the scaling occurs at training time rather that at test time. That is, during training, any neuron whose activation was not turned off, has the output divided by the dropout rate before being propagation to the next layer.  This way, at test time, no scaling is required.}


\TD{DropConnect~\cite{wan2013regularization} is similar to dropout, except that individual weights are disabled, not entire individual nodes and can be considered a generalization of dropout.}

% In relation to transfer learning and freezing, mention the difficulty of propagating updates though a large network

\TD{Paper on transfer learning effectivness..}

\r{One difficulty of fine tuning is knowing where and by how much to either freeze or learn. That is should you freeze the first $n\%$ of the network, why not $m\%$?. Maybe you should leave the entire network trainable? But if the entire network is trianable, the previously learned (and presumably useful features), may be erased by the updates. Aside from selecting where to make the distinction, the main method used to combat these issues is to modify the learning rate. There are two core methods to adjusting the learning rate to address these issues.}
