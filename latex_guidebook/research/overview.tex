\subsection{Convolution vs Cross-Correlation}
\label{conv_vs_cross}

\TD{A characteristic of the correlation operation is that if performing the operation with a kernel of size $n$, on a 2D structure of all zeros with a single `1` value padded with enough zeros such that \TD{math, $n \times 2 + 1$ }, the output is the $180 \deg $ rotated kernel. This is avoided in a convolution by performing a pre-rotation ( $180 \deg $ ).}
