\TD{learning to learn -- learning new tasks}


% quote fron Finn lecture 2
\r{``in some ways multi-task is a prereq for meta learning -- if you can't learn/solve the training tasks, you won't be able to learn new tasks''-- two ways to view meta-learning algorithms i) mechanistic view ii) probabilistic view.}

\r{use our experience from before in some way, that is learn parameters on some tasks such that we can use the learned parameters to solve new tasks}

\section{Adaptation approaches}

\subsection{Black-Box Adaptation}

\r{LSTMs or NMTs -- e.g. \cite{santoro2016meta}. NMT, external memory mechanism for storing information from training, and accessing that information when infering on new data points (in a differentiable way).}

% from lect 3, ~33min
\r{NMT is not permutation invariant, Feedforward and average is.\cite{garnelo2018conditional}}

\r{fast and slow weights -- where ``slow'' weights are related to the meta parameters and the ``fast'' weights are related to the task specific parameters.}

\r{meta-networks \cite{munkhdalai2017meta}}

\section{Optimization-based meta-learning}

\r{acquire task specific parameters through optimization -- differentiate through to the meta parameters.}

\r{meta-parameters act as a prior -- e.g. initialization then fine-tune. This is often associated with ``transfer learning'', where you train a network on some task then use those parameters for a new task. ``reusing features, and changing how those features are used for a new task -- not necessarily creating new features''.}

	\item sample task
	\item sample disjoint datasets
	\item update fine-tuning parameters?
	\item update meta parameters
\end{itemize}

% SNAIL, MetaNetworks

% in a probabilistic interp -- the meta parameters serve as a prior e.g. initialization for fine-tuning
% other forms of priors
% - Bayesian Linear regression on learned features (Rajeswaran et al implicit MAML '19)
% - Closed-form or convex optimization on learned features
% -- ridge regression, logistic regression (Bertinetto et al R2-D2 '19)
% -- SVM -- Lee et al. MetaOptNet '19

\r{challenges}
\r{choosing an arhictecture that is effective for the inner gradient step. One idea is Progressive nerual architecture search + MAML (Kim et al. Auto-Meta). a finding; non-standard (deep and narrow) were effective for MAML}
% simple tricks can help optimization
\r{Bi-level optimization is tricky -- inner and outer optimization. Couple ideas: - automatically learn inner learning rate, tune outer (Li et al. Meta-SGD,Behl et al. AlphaMAML} \r{- optimize only a subset of params in the inner loop (Zhou et al. DEML, Zintgraf et al. CAVIA)} \r{- Decouple inner learning rate, Batch norm statistics per-step (Antoniou et al. MAML++)}\r{- Introduce context variables for increased expressive power (Finn et al. bias transformation, Zintgraf el al. CAVIA)}
r{Backpropagating through many inner gradient steps is compute and memory intensive}
